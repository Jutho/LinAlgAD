This repository contains a Quarto document with a collection of derivations and notes about forward (pushforward) and reverse (pullback) rules for differentiating linear algebra factorizations.

These were derived in the context of [KrylovKit.jl](https://github.com/Jutho/KrylovKit.jl), [TensorKit.jl](https://github.com/QuantumKitHub/TensorKit.jl) and more recently, [MatrixAlgebraKit.jl](https://github.com/QuantumKitHub/MatrixAlgebraKit.jl).

This is a living document, and will be further updated or corrected. Questions, comments and in particular corrections are welcome.
